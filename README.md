This repository serves as a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstration project, showcasing practical implementation across various technologies and software architecture patterns.

## Technologies and Architectural Patterns

*   **Clean Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns into layers.
*   **Microservices:** Autonomous services.
*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Mirroring business rules into code.
*   **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separating read and write operations for improved performance and maintainability.
*   **Building Blocks:** Utilizing modular design principles to create maintainable and scalable components.
